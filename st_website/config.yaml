      Speaking five languages has opened so many doors for me. Each language offers a unique
      perspective on the world and helps me connect with different cultures.

      From Mandarin to Turkish, each language has taught me not just words, but entire ways
      of thinking. Language learning isn't just about communication—it's about understanding
      different worldviews and building bridges between cultures.
